            <h2>Skills & Education</h2>
            <p>
              I come from social sciences as a profession in general. After the
              graduation from YTU - Political Science and International
              Relations, I started MA Europen Union - Russia Studies at the
              University of Tartu, Estonia in 2018. A few years later, I've
              changed my direction to Germany! Currently I'm doing master in
              History and Culture of the Baltic Sea Region MA program. During my
              education in Estonia, I've started to develop my tech skills by
              the help of my close friends. Since then, I've been building and
              developing my career path in the field of Web Development.
